# Foodie

## Introduction

Welcome to your second large project! This is going to be a fun one that will extend your knowledge of all things front-end.  
Here are you will find the documentation for each available API endpoint for you to work with.

## `Important`

To properly identify you the user, I have assigned to you your own API key.  
Make sure you have this at the ready as **you need it to make request**

### `Sending your API key`

Sending your API key with the foodie API is done using **headers**.  
Don't worry, it is fairly simple. Let's see an example:

```
// Making a GET request

axios.request({
    url: `https://foodie.bymoen.codes/api/validate`,
    headers: {
        'x-api-key': `your_api_key_here`
    }
}).then((response) => {
    // Success code here
}).catch((error) => {
    // Failure code here
});
```

Notice within the request object I have passed a new key **headers** as an object.  
In the foodie API, you pass a header named `x-api-key` which will be used to identify you.  
**You must pass this header on every API request to the foodie API**

<br>

# Endpoints

## `Validate`
